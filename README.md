This repository uses .ods for spreadsheet file format, which LibreOffice, Microsoft Office, and Apple's Numbers can read. 

I use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) as my office suite. It's free as in freedom and free as in free beer. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS.

[Budget-Basic.ods](https://github.com/shannonwells/budgeting-tools/blob/main/Budget-Basic.ods) is a simple spreadsheet that will do some basic calculations for you. Click the "download" icon to "download raw file." After scanning the file with your anti-virus software, open it in using your spreadsheet software, and update your income and what you spend money on.  Change the "essential?" column to 1 or 0 depending on whether it is something you can't live without (e.g. food, shelter, utilities, and medical care). This will help you see how much you are spending in extras.

NerdWallet has several budget spreadsheets which I haven't looked at and can't vouch for, but they are [free to download](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/budget-worksheet). Be sure to scan the files with your malware scanner.  This page also lists some popular budgeting methods to try out based on your needs and your personality, such as 50/30/20, zero-based, cash-envelope and pay-yourself-first.

Keeping your spending in control isn't just about having a good spreadhsheet. It's important to take your personality into account when thinking about your finances. Examples: Are you an impulse spender?  Do you get a rush when you buy stuff? Do you need a beautiful home to feel good?  Do you need lots of down time?  There are ways to help with all of that.
