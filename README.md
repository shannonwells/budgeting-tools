This repository uses .ods for spreadsheet file format, which LibreOffice, Microsoft Office, and Apple's Numbers can read. 

I use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) as my office suite. It's free as in freedom and free as in free beer. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS.

[Basic-Budget](https://github.com/shannonwells/budgeting-tools/blob/main/Budget-Basic.ods) is a simple spreadsheet that will do some basic calculations for you. Click the "download" icon to "download raw file." After scanning the file with your anti-virus software, open it in using your spreadsheet software, and update your income and what you spend money on.  Change the "essential?" column to 1 or 0 depending on whether it is something you can't live without (e.g. food, shelter, utilities, and medical care). This will help you see how much you are spending in extras.
