# Is this budgeting tools, privacy advice, or financial advice?
This is meant to be a simple guide for the lowest-hanging fruit for privacy and financial security I've found a lot of people don't know about.  Here's one:

## Freeze all 3 of your credit reports. It's easy and FREE.
If you freeze your credit reports:
* Nobody can even run a credit report on you.
* Nobody can take out a new line of credit in your name + SSN.

This is the easiest stop identity theft.  Here are the 3 links to do it. They're easy to remember:
- [experian.com/freeze](https://experian.com/freeze)
- [transunion.com/freeze](https://transunion.com/freeze)
- [equifax.com/freeze](https://equifax.com/freeze)

If you do need to provide a credit report and/or get a new line of credit, you just login to the credit bureau & unfreeze it temporarily. When that's done you just freeze it again.

These "Lock" programs that the credit bureaus make you pay for? A scam.  Freeze your credit report instead.

## Need a budget?  

Start here.  After downloading the spreadsheet, fill in the values as indicated.

*ALWAYS run your malware scanner on any file you download and don't take anybody's word for it that it's clean.*

This repository uses .ods for spreadsheet file format, which LibreOffice, Microsoft Office, and Apple's Numbers can read. 

I use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) as my office suite. It's free as in freedom and free as in free beer. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS.  Also I give them money.

[Budget-Basic.ods](https://github.com/shannonwells/budgeting-tools/blob/main/Budget-Basic.ods) is a simple spreadsheet that will do some basic calculations for you. Click the "download" icon to "download raw file." After scanning the file with your anti-virus software, open it in using your spreadsheet software, and update your income and what you spend money on.  Change the "essential?" column to 1 or 0 depending on whether it is something you can't live without (e.g. food, shelter, utilities, and medical care). This will help you see how much you are spending in extras.

NerdWallet has several budget spreadsheets which I haven't looked at and can't vouch for, but they are [free to download](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/budget-worksheet). Be sure to scan the files with your malware scanner.  This page also lists some popular budgeting methods to try out based on your needs and your personality, such as 50/30/20, zero-based, cash-envelope and pay-yourself-first.

American Consumer Credit Counseling is a non-profit (501)-(c)(3) organization with [information and resources for budgeting](https://www.consumercredit.com/debt-resources-tools/budgeting), and for dealing with debt and finance, including financial calculators, information about college planning, identity theft prevention, retirement, and medical debt.  They also provide some financial counseling and education.
